# ``DBFKit``

A way to read and write DBF files.

## Overview

DBFKit is a framework written in Swift which allows you to read and write DBF files. Currently, DBFKit supports dBase III and dBase II, although it should work perfectly fine for other dbf files (such as FoxPro or dBase 7)^1

_1 Please Note: DBFKit has NOT been tested with other dBase file types!_
